# LEAF:Laminar-structured Euclidean-hyperbolic geometry-Aware feature Fusion framework

Multimodal Image Feature Fusion (MIFF) could achieve complementary advantages of different modalities, thus gaining extensive attention and application in various fields such as remote sensing observation, medical image processing, autonomous driving and so on. However, existing MIFF paradigms are mainly executed in the "flat" Euclidean space. Thus, they neglect to capture the inherent hierarchical semantic relationships between features of different levels and modalities, which distort their prior spatial layout within the feature space and further limit model performance. To address the problem, benefiting from the ability of modeling laminar structures endowed by the negative curvature, we introduce the hyperbolic geometry learning to MIFF for the first time and propose Laminar-structured Euclidean-hyperbolic geometry-Aware feature Fusion framework (LEAF). Specifically, we model the fusion features with layer-by-layer progression and their corresponding unimodal features as a leaf-like structure in hyperbolic feature space, and design a novel global spatial ranking constraint, which named Hyperbolic Hierarchical Fused-core Ranking (H2FR) Loss. Additionally, we develop Hyperbolic Distance-informed Gating Fusion Block (HDGFB), which could be used as an extension of conventional feature fusion components to effectively introduce local spatial geometric information. Experiments on multiple multimodal fusion datasets involving optical, near-infrared, radar images and so on, shows that the proposed LEAF can seamlessly integrate with most MIFF models with small parameter increment and achieve stable performance improvements.
